# part 1

Using Yoshin's "Wine_Fraud" code as a base, we'll create a tutorial outlining the steps he took to create the program, as well as a nice summary of how it works.  Then wrap it all up in a PDF format.

# part 2 

Fool around with the 'dark_or_light' examples to try and make it better/optimize it.  We each take our own approach at this, write notes of what we did in a text file, then choose the best one and give everything to Dr. Carr.

# part 3

The "Stock Market" program (stock_predictor.py) basically has everything we already need for this part.  It's just a unique program that the group has created. We could look to implement a nice GUI as a finishing touch.
