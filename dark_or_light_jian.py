Data Preprocessing
    The neural network may have difficulty converging before the maximum number of iterations allowed if the data is not normalized. 
    Multi-layer Perceptron is sensitive to feature scaling, so it is highly recommended to scale your data. 
    Note that you must apply the same scaling to the test set for meaningful results. 
    There are a lot of different methods for normalization of data, we will use the built-in StandardScaler for standardization.

Next we create an instance of the model, there are a lot of parameters you can choose to define and customize here,

    For this parameter you pass in a tuple consisting of the number of neurons you want at each layer,
